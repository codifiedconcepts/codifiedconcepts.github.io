			<p>On marenvernon.com we provide information on website design and development and printed material creation as well as the ability to hire us to perform those services (the “Service”).</p>
			<p>Use of marenvernon.com, including all materials presented herein and all online services provided by marenvernon.com, is subject to the following Terms of Service. These Terms of Service apply to all site visitors, customers, and all other users of the site. By using the Site or Service, you agree to these Terms of Service, without modification, and acknowledge reading them.</p>
		<h3>USE OF THE SITE AND SERVICE</h3>
			<p>To access or use the Site, you must be 18 years of age or older and have the requisite power and authority to enter into these Terms of Service. Children under the age of 18 are prohibited from using the Site. Information provided on the Site and in the Service related to website design and development and printed material creation and other information are subject to change. marenvernon.com makes no representation or warranty that the information provided, regardless of its source (the “Content”), is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. marenvernon.com disclaims all liability for any inaccuracy, error, or incompleteness in the Content.</p>
		<h3>ACCOUNT CREATION</h3>
			<p>In order to use the Service, you may be required to provide information about yourself including your name, email address, username and password, and other personal information. You agree that any registration information you give to marenvernon.com will always be accurate, correct, and up to date. You must not impersonate someone else or provide account information or an email address other than your own. Your account must not be used for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction.</p>
		<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
			<p>marenvernon.com respects your privacy and permits you to control the treatment of your personal information. A complete statement of marenvernon.com’s current privacy policy can be found by clicking the “privacy” link at the bottom of the page. marenvernon.com’s privacy policy is expressly incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.</p>
		<h3>LAWFUL PURPOSES</h3>
			<p>You may use the Site and Service for lawful purposes only. You agree to be financially responsible for all purchases made by you or someone acting on your behalf through the Site. You agree to use the Site and to purchase services or products through the Site for legitimate, non-commercial purposes only. You shall not post or transmit through the Site any material which violates or infringes the rights of others, or which is threatening, abusive, defamatory, libelous, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, vulgar, obscene, profane, or otherwise objectionable, contains injurious formulas, recipes, or instructions, which encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law.</p>
		<h3>REFUSAL OF SERVICE</h3>
			<p>The Services are offered subject to our acceptance of your order or requests. We reserve the right to refuse service to any order, person or entity, without the obligation to assign reason for doing so. No order is deemed accepted by us until payment has been processed. We may at any time change or discontinue any aspect or feature of the Site or Service, subject to us fulfilling our previous responsibilities to you based on acceptance of your payment.</p>
		<h3>ORDER CONFIRMATION</h3>
			<p>We will email you to confirm the placement of your order and with details concerning product delivery. In the event that there is an error in this email confirmation, it is your responsibility to inform us as soon as possible.</p>
		<h3>CANCELLATIONS, REFUNDS &amp; RETURNS</h3>
			<p>If we enter into an agreement for Services and, at some point, you or I decide our arrangement isn't working, either party can submit the desire to part ways in writing and payment for all work completed up to that point will be due. If, for instance, the website is 75% complete at the time of cancellation, you will be billed for 75% of the total project cost and 100% of any additional expenses incurred (paid fonts, images, paid plugin licenses, and anything we’ve added during the course of the project, with your approval). My inclusion of free monthly support for a year will also become void.</p>
			<p>If you decide to cancel before work on the project begins, your initial down-payment is non-refundable, as I've already invested time and cleared my schedule for your project.</p>
			<p>You will own any completed or partially completed files, which will be delivered upon project completion or cancellation after payment is rendered. Credit for work done is appreciated. I retain the right to use anything I created in my portfolio.</p>
		<h3>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</h3>
			<p>We endeavor to describe and display the Site and Service as accurately as possible. While we try to be as clear as possible in explaining the Service, please do not accept that the Site is entirely accurate, current, or error-free.
